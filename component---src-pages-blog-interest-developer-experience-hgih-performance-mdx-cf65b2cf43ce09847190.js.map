For example, I could simulate users interacting in different ways resulting in different combinations of things in their activity feeds, so I could reproduce see all edge cases and style them. Then, I realized I could run these simulations in parallel and give me a god-like overview of many different cases side-by-side, so I immediately see the impact of style changes across the product.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This lined up with what I was learning from other, more experienced programmers: awesome developer tooling doesn't only lead to faster iteration speed and better products, it also brings back a lot of joy to crafting your product.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Then, I discovered Handmade Hero, a series of videos describing how to make a video game engine from scratch. I learned that even in C, memory management is a lot simpler than what we've been told and you can hot-reload an entire game with minimal effort if you just set things up the right way. Also, I learned just how fast modern computers are and that with minimal care using a low-level language, you can make products that are easily 100x faster than lots of other products.`}</p>\n    <p>{`So my goal over the next year is to get better at systems programming using Data Oriented Design while prototyping different ideas and write about them. First up is a prototype I've written in Zig to visualize system architectures and learn about (YAML and Typescript) parsing, graph visualization and reasoning from first principles about software performance.`}</p>\n    <p>{`If any of this sounds interesting and you'd like to exchange ideas, feel free to reach out!`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
