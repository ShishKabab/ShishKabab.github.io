title: Designing modern web development workflows
preview: |
  Web development has gone through many technological iterations. Here I ask questions about what we'd want from an ideal experience, not only from the perspective of developers, but for the entire organization. And, there's some thoughts on how to get there.

- Some basic considerations

  - Feedback loop: how can we reduce the time needed from changing code, data or assets, to seeing the result on screen?

    - Do I have any manual actions to repeat?

    - How many different UI states do I need to check for a single action?

    - How fast does my code compile?

  - Developers are not the only ones working on the product

    - How can we show the progress we're making as quickly as possible with minimal effort both to safely publish and to view changes?

    - How can we relate different parts of the program to other parts of the organization?

      - How easy is it to find out why a certain design decision was made?

      - How can I see what still needs to work when I change some code?

      - How easily can I make cost projections?

      - How easily can I understand user behavior?

      - How can I see in which context which data is queried how and why?
