I'm available as a software consultant to help you develop faster sustainably. At the beginning of a project, I help you identify the things to get right to minimize the chances of blockers in the evolution of your product, and to keep the codebase a joy to work on. We'll explore hard problems you're solving, [talk about engineering culture](/blog/team-conversations-tech/), [techniques that make work easier to distribute](https://www.vdenboer.com/blog/scenario-replays/) and how to create understanding and foster collaboration across different teams. For existing products, I help you to identify blockers to keep you from growing as fast as you could, and solve complex problems you might be facing.

While I love writing code, the code I write normally serves as a base for others to work upon, showing how to solve particular problems, creating a skeleton that allows work to be easily distributed or showing certain patterns we'll be using during furher development. However, full-time coding roles are not the best way to work with me.

Over the last years as CTO of WorldBrain I've helped to build <ExternalLink href="https://memex.garden/">Memex</ExternalLink> in such a way that with a 2-developer team we were able to

<ol>
  <li>
    launch an elegant, simple and privacy-focused multi-client
    database sync mechanism
  </li>
  <li>
    transition the whole product from local-first to cloud-based in a
    very short time-frame
  </li>
  <li>
    transition a big chunk of business logic from the browser
    extension to the mobile app
  </li>
  <li>
    develop forward-thinking development workflows that allowed easy
    outsourcing of styling work and reduce daily iteration times.
  </li>
</ol>

Also, I've been [working on a technology](/katachi/presentation/) that allows

1. engineers to build design systems and complete UIs shared across different products and teams using different technologies
2. designers to directly edit the end product through a visual editor, saving them the onboarding costs to different frameworks and development styles.
3. easily trial and implement best practices like [design tokens](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/design-tokens/) with custom checks, allowing for automatic detection and fixing of best practice deviation across the entire design system

Does it sound like I could be useful to you? Let's start talking at [hello@youapt.eu](mailto:hello@youapt.eu)!
