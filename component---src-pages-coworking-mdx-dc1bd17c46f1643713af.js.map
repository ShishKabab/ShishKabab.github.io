This includes topics like new ways of working together, to evolving education in an exponential society, how to stay deeply connected as humans, community, collective intelligence and so on. Technology is a medium to experiment with these topics, not a goal in itself. I prefer new and deeper insights: \"What are the fundamental trade-offs between centralization and decentralization?\" and \"Is it possible to cultivate curiosity a large scale?\" rather than \"Look at this thing ChatGPT did!\" and \"Did you see new hot framework X? It's going to change everything!\" Deep thinkers, educators, artists, craftspeople, philosophers, all are welcome!`}</p>\n    <p>{`I work as CTO at `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://memex.garden/\"\n      }}>{`Memex`}</a>{` developing a collaborative research tool with the goal of allowing people to build on each others' research, rather than starting from zero at a Google search each time when diving into a new topic. Also, I'm developing a new UI development methodology with the goal of reducing digital product development time and costs 10x by allowing designers to do work that right now can only be done by developers.`}</p>\n    <p>{`What do you think?
