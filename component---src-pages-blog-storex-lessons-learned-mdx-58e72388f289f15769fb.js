These were classes combining schema description, pre-defined storage operations, access rules and higher-level storage operations into one place. It was a partial success. By pre-registering storage operations, we could easily programmatically see all the storage operations the program ever does. When we were using Firebase and decided we wanted to further restrict what queries users could do, we could disallow operation executions from the front-end and move them to the back-end with minimal changes.

We also wanted to be able to migrate away from Firestore. So I analyzed the use cases that were about to come up shortly and in 3 days of work I implemented a higher-level description (again, in plain data objects) of the access rules: which fields represented ownership, some data-driven logic, etc. Combined with the data-driven description of the schema, it was easy to generate Firestore rules to avoid lots of easily avoidable, but common mistakes while improving the general understandability of what was trying to be expressed. The idea was to implement a Javascript library to enforce these rules on operations from clients, so if you’re using another kind of database, you could still use the same mechanism of executing any query from clients, but filtered through these security rules.
